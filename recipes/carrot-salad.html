    <p>This carrot salad is quick and easy to make with minimal ingredients. My grandma made it all the time, and I loved it. Now I make it to honor her, and it's almost as good.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound shredded carrots</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups raisins</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix shredded carrots and raisins together in a large serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk mayonnaise, lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over carrot mixture; stir until carrots and raisins are completely coated. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
